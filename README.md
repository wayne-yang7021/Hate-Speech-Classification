# Hate-Speech-Classification

Welcome to the **Hate Speech Classification** project!

This project is all about leveraging the power of **machine learning** to detect and classify hate speech in text. Our goal is to make the internet a safer and more inclusive space by identifying offensive and harmful language before the user share it or post it.

## üåü Features

- **Dual-Model Classification:** 
  - **LinearSVC:** A powerful support vector classifier for accurate text classification.
  - **Bernoulli Naive Bayes:** A lightweight and efficient probabilistic model for quick and reliable predictions.
  
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Input your text and get instant feedback on its classification.

- **Multiclass Categorization:** 
  - Hate speech is categorized into classes such as `Disability`, `Gender`, `Origin`, `Religion`, and `Sexual_Orientation`.
  - Sentimenet speech is categorized into classes such as `Hate`,  `Offensive`, `Normal`

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built with Flask for a seamless, interactive user experience.

## üîß How It Works

1. **Preprocessing:** Text data is cleaned, tokenized, and vectorized using a custom TF-IDF representation.
2. **Feature Selection:** The most significant features are selected using statistical methods like Chi-Square.
3. **Model Training:** Both models are trained on labeled datasets for robust performance.
4. **Prediction:** User-submitted text is evaluated in real-time and classified into categories.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Hate-Speech-Classification.git
   cd Hate-Speech-Classification

2. Start the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **`app.py`**: The main Flask application.
- **`linearSVC/`**: Contains the pre-trained LinearSVC model and its dictionary.
- **`naiveBayes/`**: Contains the Naive Bayes model and supporting resources.
- **`templates/`**: HTML templates for the web interface.
- **`static/`**: CSS and other static assets.
